# Topic-Aware Abstractive Text Summarization
This repository is the artifact associated with our paper **Topic-Aware Abstractive Text Summarization**. In this paper, we propose a topic-aware abstractive summarization (TAAS) framework by leveraging the underlying semantic structure of documents represented by their latent topics.

This repository will be updated with code and detailed instructions later.

## Local Setup

Tested with Python 3.7 via virtual environment. Clone the repo, go to the repo folder, setup the virtual environment, and install the required packages:

```bash
$ python3.7 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example

We present the summaries of the same article from CNN/DM dataset from TAAS and other baseline models in ```example``` folder.
